## Directory structure

This directory contains the code used in the upstream analysis (up to and including annotation of cell types but no comparisons between guides, that is in the downstream folder) of the Perturb-seq data in our paper (the data inf Fig 4). Each subdirectory has a readme explaining what it does, except ProcessSeurat which has the code for the actual creation of the Seurat object.
